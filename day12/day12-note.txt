	DAY10: ATTRIBUTES AND METHODS 
	=======================================

    CLASS AND OBJECTS 
    ==================
=> class and objects are model real life objects 
=> class is blueprint for object 
=> attributes: vairable of the model attached to particular object 
=> methods: block of code doing particular job (concept of functions)

    CRETING OBJECTS AND ACCESSING THEIR ATTRIBUTES AND METHODS 
    ==========================================================
=> pascal casing is used with car. i.e first letter is capitalized 
=> e.g: car = CarBlueprint() (here car is object and CarBlueprint is class)
=> object holds the data individually 
=> object methods: are functions tied with it. we use methods by using dot method 

	PACKAGE VS MODULE 
	=================

=> https://pypi.org/
=> use of preetytable 
=> changing object attributes
