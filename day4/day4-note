    =======================================
	DAY6: FUNCTIONS AND KAREL 
	=======================================
=> going to build karel bot


    DEFINING AND CALLING PYTHON FUNCTIONS 
    =====================================
=> function can be defined as, 
    def function_name(inputs): 
        block of codes inside indentation

=> function can be called as
    function_name(inputs)

=> using function with loops        


    INDENTATION 
    ===========
=> each indentaion defines the block of code
=> use case of indentation with nested loops
=> ways to create indentation 
    -spaces 
    -tabs  


    WHILE LOOPS 
    ===========
=> loop keeps on running untill given condition is true, is infinite loop
=> syntax, 
    while(condition):
        block of code to execute

=> loop only exists when the condition will be false 
=> when to use for loop and when to use while loop
    when you don't care about range and items, you are concerned to result only while loop is used

    SUMMARY
    =======

    Day4 of  #100DaysOfCode 

    Today I learnt 
    -functions defination and calling
    -indentation rules
    -while loop

    Built programs for,
    -various Reeborgs World problems with loops 

    Remarks:
    Eventhough i grasped while loop concepts, maze logic still seems complex.
