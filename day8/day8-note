    DICTIONARIES
    ============

=> is a key value pair seprated by colon inside a pair of curly braces. kinda like object in js

=> dictionaries can be initialized as,
        dictionary_name = {} 

=> in each dictionary, each key is separed by comma 

=> key,value both has to be wrapped inside of double quotes
    e.g
        example_dictionary = {
            "name":"pankaj",
            "address":"dhading"
        }

=> to access the value of particluar key,
    dictionary_name["key"]

=> to add items to a dictionary, 
        dictionary_name["key"] = "value"

=> to create empty dictionary or to wipe existing dictionary
    dictionary_name = {}

=> to edit existing item of a dictionary
    dictionary_name["existing_key"] = "new_value"

=> loop through a dictionary,
    for loop can be used 
    

   NETSING LISTS AND  DICTIONARIES
   ===============================

=> nesting can be done with list and list, dictionary and dictionary
    e.g 
        travel_log={
            "France":{"cities_visited":["paris","Dijon","lille"]},
            "Nepal":{"pokhara","kathamandu","chitwan"}
        }

=> there can be dictionary in a list, dictionary in a dictionary and could be so on 
    

   FUNCTIONS WITH OUTPUT
   =====================
=> is the way to allow output at the end of the function

=> concept of return 

=> one function can have multiple return statements with conditional statements 

=> one function can have empty return statement as well

=> why return is used ?
    
=> witin docstrings (3 doublequoets/quoets) will allow us to write docuemntation of the function
    e.g
        def print_name:
            """ this function prints the name """
 

    CALCULATOR PROJECT 
    ==================

=> recurison concept
